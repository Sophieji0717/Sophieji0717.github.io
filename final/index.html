        Your digital identity is more than just your avatar, because it is something that connects all your online activity together into one passport. It is all about bringing the concept of identity into the digital world through data and visuals. A digital identity is definitely more than just an avatar and surely tells a lot more as well.

    
        Who you are in the real world is defined by your passport and social security number. Wherever you go, authorities and gatekeepers will be able to confirm you have the required age to drink a beer, are the person who bought a plane ticket and are legally allowed to drive a car. Even though those systems could end up to be tokenized in the future as well, we are likely still far away from that.
    
        However, concert or cinema tickets, reservations for an exclusive restaurant or subscriptions to a museum could very well be tokenized already. These types of identifiers do not require lots of legal background. If required, organizations could always ask for an ID card. Long story short, in the real world your identity is very important and allows gives you access to certain services.

        In the blockchain landscape we often talk about identity. Recently Polygonal Mind launched their Crypto Avatars project. They created one-of-a-kind digital characters that the owners can use in virtual worlds like Somnium Space, Decentraland and VR Chat. These avatars provide one visual look for one individual in multiple virtual worlds. However, these avatars are merely a visual representation of the true digital passport.

        I believe the concept of visual representation is the second step in creating an identity in the metaverse. The first step is an interoperable multi-chain passport in which users store all their digital identities and/or cryptocurrency wallets. A cryptocurrency wallet can already be seen as a kind of digital passport, because it tells gatekeepers all kinds of information. It shows the type of games and crypto art you like, the events you visited and your wealth.

        However, a cryptocurrency wallet is generally tied to one blockchain. In addition it does not necessarily reveal any information about your real identity, unless you have bought a domain name with your name in it. On top of that most people have multiple wallets, so one wallet never tells the whole story. But itâ€™s a fact that wallets can tell something about your tastes, activity, preferences, time zone, your nationality and identity.

        I have three different browser extensions to connect my wallets to a certain app. We need to merge all this in one interface, and allow smooth interoperability between these blockchains for sharing data. After that, we are ready to move into visual representation.
