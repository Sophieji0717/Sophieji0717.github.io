        Digital Identity More Than Just an Avatar
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        Your digital identity is more than just your avatar, because it’s something that connects all your online activity together into one passport. It’s all about bringing the concept of identity into the digital world through data and visuals. A digital identity is definitely more than just an avatar and surely tells a lot more as well.

        Who you are in the real world is defined by your passport and social security number. Wherever you go, authorities and gatekeepers will be able to confirm you have the required age to drink a beer, are the person who bought a plane ticket and are legally allowed to drive a car. Even though those systems could end up to be tokenized in the future as well, we’re likely still far away from that.
